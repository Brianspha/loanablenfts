### Loanable NFTs

This is a silly Proof of Concept DApp that allows users to list their NFTs and in return earn the value plus the token yield depending on the token used to measure the value of the NFT. For the purpose of this bounty we have chosen to keep the value with which all NFTs are measured in in DAI, This means that all users need to have sufficient DAI tokens to borrow NFTs.


### Installation
``yarn`` or ``npm i``


### Mainnet forking
Inorder to run the unit tests please ensure that you have run the ``fork.bash`` script which forks the mainnet contracts and makes them available for you to use
### Unit tests

``yarn test`` or ``npm run test``

### Deploying locally to forked network

``yarn start`` or ``npm run start``

### Frontend

I wish i had discovered the bounty earlier i would have been able to develop a UI well i did start but its not good enough to include with the submission and i was told unit tests are sufficient :XD


### Comments

My files lack comments which is something i plan on fixing after the hackathon. I also need to write more unit tests :XD
